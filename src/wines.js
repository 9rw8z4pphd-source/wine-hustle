    proIntel: "Known as the 'King of Wines'. It looks light (like Pinot) but has massive grip. Always high acid.",

    proIntel: "The 'Vanilla' flavor comes from American Oak barrels, a tradition in Rioja.",
    science: "Reserva must be aged for 3 years, with at least 1 year in oak. This softens the tannins into a silky texture.",
