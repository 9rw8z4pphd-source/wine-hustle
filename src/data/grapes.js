  "Nebbiolo": {
    style: "High Acid, High Tannin, Pale Color",
    characteristics: "Rose petals, tar, sour cherry, clay, and anise.",
    viticulture: "Thin-skinned but late-ripening. Very sensitive to 'Terroir' (soil).",
    proTip: "The 'King of Italy'. It looks like Pinot Noir but feels like a punch in the mouth. Always suggest with high-fat food like ribeye or truffle pasta."
  },
  "Sangiovese": {
    style: "High Acid, Medium-Plus Tannin",
    characteristics: "Red cherry, roasted tomato, balsamic, dried oregano.",
    viticulture: "Italy's most planted grape. Loves limestone and clay.",
    proTip: "The ultimate 'Tomato Sauce' wine. If they are eating pizza or pasta, this is the default recommendation."
  },
  "Chardonnay": {
    style: "Medium to Full Body, Soft Acid",
    characteristics: "Yellow apple, lemon, pineapple, butter, vanilla (if oaked).",
    viticulture: "The 'Chameleon'. Can be lean and mineral (Chablis) or rich and creamy (Napa).",
    proTip: "Ask the guest: 'Do you like your Chardonnay crisp and fresh, or rich and buttery?' This shows you know your stuff."
  },
  "Pinot Noir": {
    style: "High Acid, Low Tannin, Light Body",
    characteristics: "Strawberry, raspberry, mushroom, forest floor.",
    viticulture: "The 'Heartbreak Grape'. Very difficult to grow, needs cool climates.",
    proTip: "The safest red wine. If someone 'doesn't like red wine,' give them a chilled Pinot Noir."
  },
  "Syrah/Shiraz": {
    style: "Full Body, Medium Acid, High Alcohol",
    characteristics: "Blackberry jam, plum, black pepper, bacon fat, chocolate.",
    viticulture: "Called Syrah in France (savory) and Shiraz in Australia (fruit bomb).",
    proTip: "If they want a 'Big Red' but find Cabernet too dry/bitter, give them a Shiraz. It's juicier."
  },
  "Sauvignon Blanc": {
    style: "High Acid, Light Body, Intense Aroma",
    characteristics: "Grass, gooseberry, grapefruit, passionfruit, flint.",
    viticulture: "Aggressive grower. Loves gravelly soils.",
    proTip: "Tell guests: 'It's like a squeeze of lime on your palate.' Pairs perfectly with seafood or goat cheese."
