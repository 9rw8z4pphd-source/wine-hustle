  "Nebbiolo": {
    vibe: "The Tough Sophisticate",
    color: "Translucent Garnet (looks like tea)",
    body: "Heavy / High Tannin",
    basic: "Smells like roses and old leather. Very dry.",
    science: "Late ripening grape that needs specific limestone soils to develop its 'tar' aroma.",
    proTip: "If a guest likes 'Bold' but wants something more elegant than Shiraz, this is it."
  },
  "Sangiovese": {
    vibe: "The Italian Soul",
    color: "Bright Ruby",
    body: "Medium / High Acid",
    basic: "Cherries, dried tomatoes, and herbs.",
    science: "Thin skin means it reflects the earth easily (terroir). High acidity makes it the best food wine.",
    proTip: "The #1 recommendation for anything with tomato sauce or balsamic."
  },
  "Malbec": {
    vibe: "The Velvet Hammer",
    color: "Opaque Deep Purple (often with a magenta rim)",
    body: "Full / Smooth",
    basic: "Plum, blueberry, and milk chocolate.",
    science: "Thrives in high altitudes (Argentina) where UV rays thicken the skins for deep color.",
    proTip: "For the guest who wants 'Smooth and Dark' with no bitterness."
  },
  "Riesling": {
    vibe: "The Electric White",
    color: "Pale Straw / Green",
    body: "Light / Intense Acid",
    basic: "Lime, green apple, and sometimes 'petrol' (gasoline) smell.",
    science: "Naturally high in tartaric acid. It’s the best wine for aging (can last 20+ years).",
    proTip: "Perfect for spicy food (Thai/Indian) or guests who find Chardonnay too 'heavy'."
  },
  "Cabernet Sauvignon": {
    vibe: "The Boss",
    color: "Deep Ruby / Black",
    body: "Heavy / Structured",
    basic: "Blackcurrant (Cassis), cedar wood, and bell pepper.",
    science: "High levels of 'Pyrazines' give it that herbal/green pepper note.",
    proTip: "The 'safe' choice for luxury. If they want a big steak wine, this is the gold standard."
  },
  "Tempranillo": {
    vibe: "The Smooth Spaniard",
    color: "Ruby Red",
    body: "Medium-Full",
    basic: "Leather, vanilla, tobacco, and red plums.",
    science: "Low acidity compared to Sangiovese. Takes very well to American Oak (vanilla notes).",
    proTip: "For people who find Cabernet too 'dry' but want something serious."
